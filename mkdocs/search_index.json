(count of items saved per user)\n\n\nHow often? (number of credentials saved per time interval)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo people create their own passwords or use Lockbox to generate them?\n\n\nRatio: (Number of times the PW generator is used when storing an item) / (number of credentials stored)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo people use the passwords they store on Lockbox?\n\n\nHow many times (per some unit of time) do stored credentials get auto-filled?\n\n\nHow many times do they copy a credential (e.g. to fill it in manually)\n\n\nHow many times do they reveal a credential in the CRUD editor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow well does does auto-filling credentials work \n(not in alpha)\n?\n\n\nWhen credentials are auto-filled, are they filled into the correct fields?\n\n\nHow often must the user make a change to what fields were filled?\n\n\nHow to measure these things??? is there an easier way than just asking if the auto-fill didn't work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo people continue to use Lockbox after first use?\n\n\nOut of those who install, how many use it more than once?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere are the drop-off points in the user flow?\n\n\nDo the majority of people make it all the way through the setup process?\n\n\nOnce initially setup, do people continue to add credentials?\n\n\nDo people continue to auto-fill credentials after the first usage?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are people's opinions on LB\n\n\nFeedback forms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo people sync their passwords \n(not in alpha)\n?\n\n\nHow does syncing affect engagement?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe: what type of sites do people use Lockbox with \n(not in alpha)\n?\n\n\n\n\nCollection\n\n\nNote:\n \nThis is the collection plan for our internal alpha release. For our beta release will be taking advantage of test pilot's telemetry API. The metrics plan for beta will be described in a separate document.\n\n\nAt this point, all measurements related to Lockbox will be made client-side. All users will have to authenticate through FxA, and thus additional measurements related to that will be logged on the FxA auth server. We have no control over what is already collected via that mechanism.\n\n\nFor our internal alpha release, we will be making use of the public JavaScript API that allows recording and sending of event data through an add-on. \nThis means that for our alpha release we will only be collecting event-based data\n. The API is documented here:\n\n\nhttps://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/collection/events.html#the-api\n\n\nOnce the events are logged in the client they should appear in \nabout:telemetry\n. From there they will be submitted in the main ping payload under \nprocesses.dynamic.events\n and available through the usual services (STMO and ATMO), as well as amplitude.\n\n\nEvent Registration and Recording\n\n\nThe events that we will record will conform to the structure expected by the telemetry pipeline. When the events are logged in telemetry they will be a list of:\n\n\n[timestamp, category, method, object, value, extra]\n\n\nThe API takes care of the timestamp for us. We just need to define \ncategory\n, \nmethod\n, \nobject\n and \nextra\n (\nvalue\n is optional and we won't use it).\n\n\nBecause we are using the API through an add-on it \nisn't\n necessary that we include an events.yaml file.\n\n\nInstead we will define our events by \nregistering\n them using a call to \nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(category, eventData)\n.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of how a to register a typical event:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nevent_category\n, {\n    \nevent_name\n: {\n        methods: [\nclick\n, ... ], // types of events that can occur\n        objects: [\na_button\n, ... ], // objects event can occur on\n        extra: {\nkey\n: \nvalue\n, ... } // key-value pairs (strings)\n    }\n\n\n\n\nFor our purposes, we will use the \nextra\n field for a few purposes:\n\n\n\n\nTo log the FxA user id of the client logging the event (e.g. \n\"fxauid\": uid\n)\n\n\nTo log the UUID of the item that has been added or changed (e.g. \n\"item_id\": UUID\n)\n\n\nTo log the fields that are modified when an item is updated in the datastore (e.g. \n\"fields\": \"password,notes\"\n  (because the value has to be a string we will have to concat the fields that were updated somehow)\n\n\n\n\nOnce an event is registered, we can record it with:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(category, method, object, null, extra)\n\n\nWhen recording, we can use \nnull\n for \nvalue\n.\n\n\nSee the Events section for specific examples of event registration and recording.\n\n\nMetrics Overview\n\n\nFor alpha, we'd like to (ideally) like to be able to track the following general categories of things:\n\n\n\n\nThe setup flow, so we can know at what points (if any) people quit the flow before finishing it\n\n\nTop-level interactions centered around use of the Lockbox toolbar icon. This includes interactions within the initial pop-over that is displayed when the user clicks the icon.\n\n\nInteractions with the main CRUD editor view which lists the user's Lockbox items (credentials)\n\n\nInteractions with the add / modify dialogs used to enter / edit item information\n\n\nChanges to the datastore that actually contains the user's items, in addition to user actions that lead to those changes\n\n\nWhen the user submits feedback about lockbox\n\n\n\n\nEach of these are described below within their own Events subsection.\n\n\nNon-Event Metrics\n\n\nThese are the metrics we plan to collect regarding the state of user datastores. Note that we won't be able to record these directly for alpha. We will have to infer them from the event data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn_items\n The number of credentials that exist in the user's datastore. Integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn_notes\n The number of items for which the user has manually entered custom notes for. Integer\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp_last\n The timestamp of the last edit the user made to the datastore. Does not necessarily correspond to the last time they opened the CRUD editor.\n\n\n\n\n!!!!!!! EVERYTHING BELOW HERE IS OLD AND OUT OF DATE NOT IMPLEMENTED KEPT HERE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE ONLY !!!!!!!\n\n\nSetup Events\n\n\nFrom a metrics point of view, the FxA sign-in / account creation process is a black box to us. Thus the best we can do at this point is track when a user interacts with the Lockbox-specific views that are included in the first run flow.\n\n\nWe have two \ncategories\n of events here: rendering events and interaction events:  \nlockbox_setup.render\n and \nlockbox_setup.interaction\n. For rendering events, the \nobject\n field is populated by the name of the view being rendered; for interaction events the \nobject\n is the name of the button. Below is a brief description of the view names and their corresponding buttons.\n\n\n\n\nlockbox_toolbar_firstrun\n\n\nPop-over shown when the user first clicks on the Lockbox toolbar icon after install. Contains the \nget_started_button\n. Note that the click on the toolbar icon itself is logged in a separate event (see \"Toolbar Button Interaction Event\" section below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreenter_password\n\n\nShown after FxA process is completed. Prompts user to re-enter their FxA pw to start using lockbox. Contains the \nlockbox_signin_button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmethods\n for these events are \nrender\n and \nclick\n for rendering and interaction events, respectively.\n\n\nThe \nextra\n field contains the user's FxA anonymous/random user id. For \nlockbox_toolbar_firstrun\n view this will be \nnull\n.\n\n\nTo register the rendering events:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nlockbox_setup.render\n, {\n  \nlockbox_setup.render\n: {\n    methods: [\nrender\n],\n    objects: [\nlockbox_toolbar_firstrun\n, // startup flow views\n            \nreenter_password\n],\n    extra: {\nfxauid\n: uid} // value is null in some cases, see above\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nTo register the interaction events:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nlockbox_setup.interaction\n, {\n  \nlockbox_setup.click\n: {\n    methods: [\nclick\n],\n    objects: [\nget_started_button\n, // start-up flow buttons\n              \nlockbox_signin_button\n],\n    extra: {\nfxauid\n: uid} // value is null in some cases, see above\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nAn example of how to record a rendering of the \nreenter_password\n view:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(\nlockbox_setup.render\n,\n                    \nrender\n,\n                    \nreenter_password\n,\n                    null,\n                    {\nfxauid\n: uid} ) // user has signed in by now);\n\n\n\n\nTo record (for example) a click on one of the \nlockboxSignin_button\n button:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(\nlockbox_setup.interaction\n,\n                    \nclick\n,\n                    \nlockbox_signin_button\n,\n                    null,\n                    {\nfxauid\n: null} ) // user hasn't signed in yet);\n\n\n\n\nItem list Interaction Events\n\n\nThese events relate to interactions with the item list rendered after a click of the Lockbox toolbar button. These events assume that the user has already logged in with FxA. For events related to the setup flow, see the section above.\n\n\nImmediately after setup there will be no items in the datastore. As long as this is the case, the item list will be empty and the user will have to click the \nadd_new_button\n to add their first entry. As long as there is at least one entry in the datastore, the item list will be displayed in the left pane.\n\n\nWe will have two categories of events related to the item list: \nlockbox_item_list.render\n and \nlockbox_item_list.interaction\n. They will be recorded as \nlockbox_item_list.render\n and \nlockbox_item_list.click\n.\n\n\nFor the rendering events, there are two possible objects, \nitem_list_empty\n and \nitem_list_populated\n corresponding to a rendering of an empty item list and an item list with at least one entry, respectively.\n\n\nThe possible \nmethods\n are \nclick\n and \nrender\n.\n\n\nThe \nobjects\n are \nitem_button\n (the clickable area of an entry in the item list), \nfeedback_button\n, \nadd_new_button\n (available so long as there at least one item in the datastore), and \nsearch_box\n.\n\n\nTo register the interaction events:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nlockbox_item_list.interaction\n, {\n  \nlockbox_item_list.click\n: {\n    methods: [\nclick\n],\n    objects: [\nitem_button\n,\n        \nfeedback_button\n,\n        \nadd_new_button\n,\n        \nsearch_box\n],\n    extra: {\nfxauid\n: uid}\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nTo register the render events:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nlockbox_item_list.render\n, {\n  \nlockbox_item_list.render\n: {\n    methods: [\nrender\n],\n    objects: [\nitem_list_empty\n,\n        \nitem_list_populated\n],\n    extra: {\nfxauid\n: uid}\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nTo record (for example) a click on the add new entry button:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(\nlockbox_item_list.interaction\n,\n                    \nclick\n,\n                    \nadd_new_button\n,\n                    null,\n                    {\nfxauid\n: uid});\n\n\n\n\nItem View Interaction Events\n\n\nWhen a user clicks on an item from the item list, they will be directed to the item view. We will log clicks on each of the five buttons in this view (also the \nobjects\n used in the event): \nedit_entry_button\n, \ndelete_entry_button\n, \nshow_password_button\n, \ncopy_password_button\n, and \ncopy_username_button\n.\n\n\nThe event \ncategory\n is \nitem_view.interaction\n and the event is recorded as \nitem_view.click\n.\n\n\nThe \nmethod\n is \nclick\n.\n\n\nExample event registration:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nlockbox_item_view.interaction\n, {\n  \nlockbox_item_view.click\n: {\n    methods: [\nclick\n],\n    objects: [\nedit_entry_button\n,\n        \ndelete_entry_button\n,\n        \nshow_password_button\n,\n        \ncopy_password_button\n,\n        \ncopy_username_button\n],\n    extra: {\nfxauid\n: uid}\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nExample of recording a click to show password event:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(\nlockbox_item_view.interaction\n,\n                    \nclick\n,\n                    \nshow_password_button\n,\n                    null,\n                    {\nfxauid\n: uid});\n\n\n\n\nEvents Related to Interactions in the Item Editors\n\n\nThese events record actions users take in the item editors. There are separate views for editing existing items and for adding new entries, though the fields that exist in each are similar. Thus we have four \ncategories\n of events: \nlockbox_new_item.interaction\n, \nlockbox_edit_item.interaction\n and the rendering events \nlockbox_new_item.render\n and \nlockbox_edit_item.render\n.\n\n\nFor events related to the submission of actual item information, see the next section. The item editors have 5 fields: \ntitle_field\n, \norigin_field\n (URL for the credential), \nusername_field\n, \npassword_field\n, and \nnotes_field\n. There are also three buttons: \nsave_entry_button\n, \ncancel_button\n, and \ntoggle_password_button\n. The latter toggles the visibility of characters in the password field.  \n\n\nThe \nmethods\n are \nclick\n and \nrender\n.\n\n\nExample event registration (Substitute \nlockbox_new_item\n with \nlockbox_edit_item\n to register events for the existing item editor):\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nlockbox_new_item.interaction\n, {\n  \nlockbox_item_editor.click\n: {\n    methods: [\nclick\n],\n    objects: [\ntitle_field\n,\n        \norigin_field\n,\n        \nusername_field\n,\n        \npassword_field\n,\n        \nnotes_field\n,\n        \nsave_entry_button\n,\n        \ncancel_button\n,\n        \ntoggle_password_button\n],\n    extra: {\nfxauid\n: uid}\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nFor the rendering events:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nlockbox_new_item.render\n, {\n  \nlockbox_item_editor.render\n: {\n    methods: [\nrender\n],\n    objects: [\nlockbox_new_item_view\n],\n    extra: {\nfxauid\n: uid}\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nExample of recording a click on the \nsave_entry_button\n:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(\nlockbox_item_editor.interaction\n,\n                    \nclick\n,\n                    \nsave_entry_button\n,\n                    null,\n                    {\nfxauid\n: uid});\n\n\n\n\nEvents Related to Submitting An Item Change from the Item Editors\n\n\nEvents of \ncategory\n \nlockbox_item_change_submitted\n record the actual submission of new item information to the datastore (either completely new entries or updates to existing items).\n\n\nIn theory, these should be tied to equivalent events in the datastore, so that (for example) an \nadding\n event which is logged when a user submits a new item has a corresponding \nadded\n event that gets logged when the item is successfully added to the datastore. This may need to change, but for simplicity's sake I've made it as close to the datastore events as possible (see next section). These events will be recorded as \nlockbox_item_change_submitted\n.\n\n\nMethods\n for this event are \nadding\n, \nupdating\n and \ndeleting\n.\n\n\nThe \nobject\n can be \nnew_item\n or \nedit_item\n.\n\n\nThe \nextra\n field contains the item's UUID \nfor updating and deleting events only\n. For adding events, it always contains the string \"new\".\n\n\nTo register these events, we would do something like:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nlockbox_item_change_submitted\n, {\n  \nlockbox_item_change_submitted\n: {\n    methods: [\nadding\n,\nupdating\n,\ndeleting\n],\n    objects: [\nnew_item\n,\nedit_item\n],\n    extra: {\nfxauid\n: uid,\n            \nitem_id\n: UUID}\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nTo record a new item submission (note the \nitem_id\n is \"new\"):\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(\nlockbox_item_change_submitted\n,\n                    \nadded\n,\n                    \nnew_item\n,\n                    null,\n                    {\nfxauid\n: uid,\n                    \nitem_id\n: \nnew\n});\n\n\n\n\nEvents Related to Changes in the Datastore\n\n\nWe will record an event of \ncategory\n \nlockbox_datastore.changed\n when there is a change to the datastore. These events will be recorded as \nlockbox_entry_changed\n.\n\n\nMethods\n for this event are \nadded\n, \nupdated\n and \ndeleted\n.\n\n\nThe \nobject\n field is always \ndatastore\n.\n\n\nThe \nextra\n field contains the item's (hashed) UUID. This will allow us to track changes to an item over its lifetime. When the method is \nupdated\n, this field also includes a list indicating which fields in the credential were updated.\n\n\nTo register these events, we would do something like:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nlockbox_datastore.changed\n, {\n  \nlockbox_entry_changed\n: {\n    methods: [\nadded\n,\nupdated\n,\ndeleted\n],\n    objects: [\ndatastore\n],\n    extra: { \nfxauid\n: uid,\n    \nitem_id\n: UUID,\n    \nfields\n: \ntitle,origins,login.password,login.notes\n }  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nAn example of logging an item update in the datastore:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(\nlockbox_database.changed\n,\n                    \nupdated\n,\n                    \ndatastore\n,\n                    null,\n                    {\nfxauid\n: uid,\n                    \nitem_id\n: UUID,\n                    \nfields\n: \nusername,password\n});\n\n\n\n\nFeedback Events\n\n\nWhen the user enters the feedback form through the button on the item list, we will record an event when a user submits feedback. Note that this will \nnot\n contain the feedback itself: that is logged elsewhere (not thru telemetry).\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nlockbox_feedback.interaction\n, {\n  \nlockbox_feedback_submit.click\n: {\n    methods: [\nclick\n],\n    objects: [\nsubmit_button\n],\n    extra: {\nfxauid\n: uid}\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nTo record (for example) a click of the toolbar:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(\nlockbox_feedback.interaction\n,\n                    \nclick\n,\n                    \nsubmit_button\n,\n                    null,\n                    {\nfxauid\n: uid});\n\n\n\n\nFill Events: TBD\n\n\nThis section will describe the events related to auto-filling login credentials on web forms using items from the datastore. Since this isn't invented yet, its empty.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nDocs for the Public JS API that allows us to log events thru an add-on:\n\n\nhttps://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/collection/events.html#the-api",

All users will have to authenticate through FxA, and thus additional measurements related to that will be logged on the FxA auth server. We have no control over what is already collected via that mechanism.  For our internal alpha release, we will be making use of the public JavaScript API that allows recording and sending of event data through an add-on.

For the rendering events, there are two possible objects,  item_list_empty  and  item_list_populated  corresponding to a rendering of an empty item list and an item list with at least one entry, respectively.

For events related to the submission of actual item information, see the next section. The item editors have 5 fields:  title_field ,  origin_field  (URL for the credential),  username_field ,  password_field , and  notes_field . There are also three buttons:  save_entry_button ,  cancel_button , and  toggle_password_button . The latter toggles the visibility of characters in the password field.

In theory, these should be tied to equivalent events in the datastore, so that (for example) an  adding  event which is logged when a user submits a new item has a corresponding  added  event that gets logged when the item is successfully added to the datastore. This may need to change, but for simplicity's sake I've made it as close to the datastore events as possible (see next section). These events will be recorded as  lockbox_item_change_submitted .  Methods  for this event are  adding ,  updating  and  deleting .  The  object  can be  new_item  or  edit_item .  The  extra  field contains the item's UUID  for updating and deleting events only .
